  <H2> Jelly Basics </H2>
 <p> Jellyfish are part of the phylum cnidaria, which includes sea anemonies and coral. Animals that are part of the phylum as soft bodied and can sting as a form of self defense or when capturing their prey. <br/> 
  Cnidarians are mainly found in aquatic environments. Jellyfish are made up of three layers: the epidermis (outer layer), mesoglea (middle layer made out of a thick jelly like substance), and the gastrodermis (inner layer). Jellyfish have no coelom and therefore no cephalisation, meaning the have no brain, blood or even hearts. A coelom is a fluid-dilled body cavity inside of the animal, it allows for growth which in turn allows for the formation of internal organs. </p>
